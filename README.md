# mobile-app-signlanguagetranslator

It is a mobile application system developed using java language and python language. It has Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning elements. It use to translate sign language to text using camera. The model developed using ASL dataset. The tools use are Android Studio and Jupyter Notebook.


Model Development

Tool: The model was developed by using Google Colaboratory.Colab is a Python Web editor that can write arbitrary Python code and execute them for everyone. It is particularly useful for machine learning, data processing and training. 

Language: The programming language use to create the model is python. Python is a high-level, dynamic, accessible, translated programming language. Python is intended to be a very understandable language.

Dataset: The data was collected from Kaggle repository (https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/asl-dataset). In this study, the datasets contains 2515 files of data with 36 data

A Mobile Application Development

For the user's convenience, a mobile application was created. The mobile application must be integrated with the previously built model so that the system can analyse the user's input and determine the consequence. 

Tools: The system developed using android studio.The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development is Android Studio[18]. 

Language: The system code using java programming language.Java is an object-oriented programming language with a high level of abstraction.
